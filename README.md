## Information
This is a very simple and powerful shopify monitor script\
Because is always uptodate, extremely lightweight and efficient, this shopify monitor is better than a lot of paid monitor, COVID-19 brings also good things

### Notification example

This is an example of discord notification that monitor will send to you

**ATC** and **Cart** are very usefull links\
If you click the ATC link the site'll add automatically the corresponding product in your cart, then you can click the Cart link to jump istantly to the cart with the product already inside

These links are very useful for speeding up the purchase of products


Follow the few steps below to set the environment and start the monitor

### Before we start: requirements

#### Git

If you didn't install git before, do it, now! --> [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Npm & Node js

If you don't have installed npm or node js go to this page: [node js](https://nodejs.org/it/download/) download and install node js

#### Mongo DB

You can install mongo db following this guide: [mongo db](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

If you need some help to install it you can see this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwMwO8pXfq0&t=552s

#### NOTE: I've git version 2.26.2, node js version 12.16.3, mongodb version 4.2.6. If you have any problems with the monitor, try to update your setup with my versions

### Prepare the environment

Open your cmd and run

```node
git clone https://github.com/Dam998/shopify-monitor.git
```

Open the config.json file: add shopify sites and set your discord webhook url (if you want you can also edit the request timing, I recommend to don't do it, it's not necessary, if you decrease that time you can be banned from the site)

Then go inside the project folder and run:

```node
npm install
```

### Start the monitor

To start the monitor run this:

```node
npm start
```

That's all, the shopify monitor has been started, if it finds a product it will notify you on discord

When the monitor starts it sends a discord message, if you don't receive a discord message from the monitor it means there is a problem with the webhook url
